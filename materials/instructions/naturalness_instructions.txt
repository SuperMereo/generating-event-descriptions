In this survey, you will be presented with 100 sentences and asked to judge how natural each one is using a scale ranging from extremely unnatural to perfectly natural. A natural sentence is something that a native speaker of English would naturally and fluently say, following the implicit structural rules of English. For example, consider the following sentences using "sleep":

Example Sentences:

1. The baby seems sleep to be.
2. The baby seems to be sleeping.
3. The toothbrush seems to be sleeping.

Example 1 ("The baby seems sleeping to be") is an unnatural sentence, since "sleep to be" does not follow the structural rules of English.

Example 2 ("The baby seems to be sleeping") is perfectly natural: it makes sense and follows all the structural rules of English.

Example 3 ("The toothbrush seems to be sleeping") is also somewhat natural, because -- even though it doesn't make sense (toothbrushes don't sleep) -- it does follow the structural rules of English.

Does this make sense?
