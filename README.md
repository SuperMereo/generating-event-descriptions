# Generating Event Descriptions under Syntactic and Semantic Constraints

This repository contains materials, data, and analysis code for the 
following paper:

> Cao, Angela, Faye Holt, Jonas Chan, Stephanie Richter, Lelia Glass, and Aaron Steven White. 2024. [Generating event descriptions under syntactic and semantic constraints](https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/008208/current.pdf).

We ask that you cite both that paper and this repository if you use 
the code or data found here.

## Getting Started

First, download the code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SuperMereo/generating-event-descriptions.git
```

Then, build the Docker image:

```bash
cd item-validation
docker build -t generating-event-descriptions .
```

Finally, run a container based on the image, ensuring access to the
current directory.

```bash
docker run -it --rm --user $(id -u):$(id -g) --group-add users -v "$(pwd)":/home/jovyan -p 8888:8888 generating-event-descriptions
```

### `data`

This directory contains data lightly processed for the purposes of 
anonymization and readability. Each row details one annotation instance.

### `scripts`

This directory contains scripts to both perform statistical analyses on 
our raw data and generate the experimental items.

### `materials`

This directory contains the materials needed to reproduce our experiments.

### `results`

This directory contains figures generated by our analysis scripts.
