    Describe and enumerate the distinct possible senses of the verb 'understand' when it is found in a transitive clause. 
Feel free to give only one sense if it only has one possible meaning. 
For example, if you were given the verb ""abandon”, you should respond with “1. leave behind; 2. exchange; 3. surrender, give over” since ""abandon"" has three transitive senses. 
For another example, the verb ""jump"" has five senses because it has multiple possible meanings when it is used, so you should output something like ""1. stock prices, increase, 2. be excited for an opportunity, getting there first, 3. physically or metaphorically leap, physical motion, 4. to escape, bail out, 5. attack, gangsta style"".

4. Emphasize or highlight something: This sense of ""understand"" is often used to emphasize a particular aspect of the object or action described by the verb. For example: ""I understand the most important part of the project.""
