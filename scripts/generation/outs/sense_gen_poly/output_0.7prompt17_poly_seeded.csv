Feel free to give only one sense if it only has one possible meaning. 
For example, if you were given the verb ""administrate"", you should respond with ""manage"" because ""administrate"" has one transitive sense. 
For another example, the verb ""jump"" has five senses because it has multiple possible meanings when it is used, so you should output something like ""1. stock prices, increase, 2. be excited for an opportunity, getting there first, 3. physically or metaphorically leap, physical motion, 4. to escape, bail out, 5. attack, gangsta style"".

    Sure! Here are the distinct possible senses of the verb 'understand' when it is found in a transitive clause:

1. Comprehend the meaning of something: ""She finally understood the instructions.""
2. Interpret the intention behind an action or statement: ""He understood her sarcastic tone.""
3. Grasp the significance or relevance of something: ""The student did not understand the importance of the lesson.""
4. Appreciate or come to see the value of something: ""I understand why you are so upset.""
5. Be familiar with or have knowledge of something: ""She understands the concept of gravity.""

Note that some of these senses may overlap or be related to each other, but they are distinct enough to be considered separate meanings of the verb 'understand' in transitive clauses.</s>"
