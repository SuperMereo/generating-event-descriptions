    Describe and enumerate the distinct possible senses of the verb 'understand' when it is found in a transitive clause. 
Feel free to give only one sense if it only has one possible meaning. 
For example, if you were given the verb ""administrate"", you should respond with ""manage"" because ""administrate"" has one transitive sense. 
For another example, the verb ""jump"" has five senses because it has multiple possible meanings when it is used, so you should output something like ""1. stock prices, increase, 2. be excited for an opportunity, getting there first, 3. physically or metaphorically leap, physical motion, 4. to escape, bail out, 5. attack, gangsta style"". 
Ensure that the sense description(s) can stand alone and do not depend on being the synonym of some other verb. [/INST]
